Tetris
======

I read a position description that asked a person be proficient enough to be able to write tetris withtout any external code. I decided to give it a try. I Also figured I could build on it and display my experience using other tools and web technologies. I gave myself a time limit of a weekend. I got it functional. But I spent more time afterwards cleaning up code. Trying not to build on the logic any more and just cleaning and adding a little bit of color. 

My thoughts after building the project. The process was very painful. I forgot how much we take a lot of the tools we use for granted. The lack of a bootstrap (Twitter Bootsrap), utility functions (lodash.js), or even development workflow tools (livereload). I also could have saved a lot of effort using a game engine. Taking advantage of collision detection, event management systems, and rednering engines. But in the end you should build for the occasion. It was a good practice in scope and compromise.

Someone can once told me, "Just because you can stand the heat, doesn't mean you have to go through the fire." I definitely agree. I could have focused on my advanced features Networking, User Input methods. But in the end it was a great experience. Feel free to add comments.
